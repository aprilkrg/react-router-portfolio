export default App
// Problems:
// change style of function to export default function () {} -- cause that's whats in the react docsand it's mroe efficient to type. the arrow function doesn't bind `this` or anything
// diff between jsx and js
// how to export multiple components from pages dir
// source ^ https://dev.to/cyishere/export-multiple-components-in-index-file-el3
// calling it a blog page is one thing, but building "blog" into the url doesn't make sense because the actual resource here would be "posts"
// solution ^ I'll call it the "blog" page anywhere the user can see it, except for the urls, which I'm gonna build out with a RESTful api in mind
// stretch goal: a button that gets lorem ipsum from an api

// import from react-router-dom
// set up routes
// make components/pages and components/partials
// make component files
// stub up components
// make an Index.js in components/pages
// export files there so import in App is cleaner
// see error in dev tools
// change file type to Index.jsx and errors go away

// make Header partial with navbar
// export header from a partials/Index.js

// blog posts next
// make array of post data in app and pass as props to Posts
// get lorem ipsum from http://fillerama.io/
// make Post component in pages
// design ui

// ... and then I made the posts render on the right url ...

// get ready to add state to app
// make component tree diagram
